  "description": "In this example, we have a CongestionControlAlgorithm class that represents the congestion control logic. It maintains the current window size and threshold values. The handlePacketAcknowledgment method is called when a packet is acknowledged, and it adjusts the window size accordingly based on the congestion phase. The handlePacketLoss method is called when a packet loss is detected, and it adjusts the window size and threshold based on the congestion control rules.t to see the window size adjustments after a packet acknowledgment and a packet loss.",
